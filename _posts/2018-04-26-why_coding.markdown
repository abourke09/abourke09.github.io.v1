It's hard to live in San Francisco without getting caught up in coding somehow. I'm grateful to be here where so many people are dreaming big, creating new things, and thinking outside the box. Not every entrepreneur will have a top-notch idea, but if I've learned anything from living here it's that you might as well try. 

So I'm going to try- I'll do my best to learn what I can and not be intimidated by the endless amounts of information. Because at the end of the day, it's fun. That's why I'm here. People compare coding to many different things, but it reminds me most of building. Whether it's sculpting something in clay or writing a proof in geometry, the process and feeling of accomplishment are the same. Coding may be a bit more technical, but it's still about using your imagination and the tools available to create something you're proud of. 

The truly stunning thing about coding -to me- is it's utility. I'm hard pressed to think of a situation where computer programing wouldn't be useful. It seems like no matter what impact you want to have on the world, this skillset can help in some way. 

I'm hoping I can look back in five years and be proud of the progress I've made. Sometimes it's hard to tell when you're in the trenches whether you're making any headway at all. Perspective is everthing, so I'll settle for one small step at time and trust that it'll get me somewhere.
