My project concept is an webapp that allows users to make decisions in a group using a "Draw Staws" technique. A good use case would be a group of roommates deciding who has to do which chores in a home. In this example, there might be three roommates and three different chores- cleaning the bathroom, cleaning the kitchen, and vacuuming the living room. 

If they were playing Draw Straws in real life, they might each choose a piece of straw from a bundle of straws of varying lengths. The person with the longest piece would get to choose their preferred chore first. The person with the second longest straw would then choose from the remaining two. The person with the shortest straw would have to take the last remaining chore option. 

In this webapp, the straws of varying length are replaced with a function that randomly shuffles the players and assigns each player their draw order from that random shuffle. Once the game name and number of players are set, the player names and options can be entered. From there, the players are shuffled and each in turn is given the chance to choose their preferred option. Once all of the players have chosen an option, the game is saved and redirects to the Game Show page.
